Early life: 

Ants marching along the floor. Everytime I walked into the kitchen of the first house I ever lived in, thats all I could see: ants marching along the floor. We had these tiles in the kitchen that had 
almost roman looking lines with squiggly little ants lining them. 
I was born in San Antonio, Texas, to two parents who had already suffered so much in their own lives. I grew up on the south side of San Antonio where every 
street had potholes and front yards were overgrown and cluttered with lawn decorations.
