The battle took place on October 9, 1835 when texas soldiers, or rebels as they were called, attacked the mexican army soldiers that were posted at Presidio La Bahia, which was near the Texas settlement of Goliad. The battle lasted less than a day, but the way it changed Texas history was immeasurable. James Fannin led the rebels in the battle of goliad which was victorious for Texas, but led to a unanimous fear of the Texas public that sparked more wars and battles against mexico, and countless more deaths in the fight for freedom.
