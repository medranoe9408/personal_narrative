The Battle of Goliad, also known as the Goliad Massacre, was the second confrontation of the Texas Revolution, between the Texans and the Mexican army. The battle took place on October 9, 1835 when texas soldiers, or rebels as they were called, attacked the mexican army soldiers that were posted at Presidio La Bahia, which was near the Texas settlement of Goliad. The battle lasted less than a day, but the way it changed Texas history was immeasurable. James Fannin led the rebels in the Battle of Goliad which was victorious for Texas, but led to a unanimous fear of the Texas public that sparked more wars and battles against Mexico, and countless more deaths in the fight for freedom. 

During the Battle of Goliad, the rebels cried out, "Remember Goliad" which resembles a different well known battle cry “Remember the Alamo” that was used at the Battle of the Alamo. Both of these battles have changed Texas history, and while the Battle of Goliad is less known, it resulted in many more battles, and ultimately contributed to Texas winning its independence. Under James Fannin’s command, there were about four hundred people, but this was to no avail. There were countless innocent deaths during the battle because the Mexican army commander, Santa Anna, wanted to punish the Texan rebels because he saw them as miscreants and pirates who deserved to be executed. After they had already surrendered, the Mexican army killed an additional three hundred Texans. After the battle, the Mexican army burned the bodies of the dead Texans because Sam Huston gave no directions for what was to be done with the bodies. 

Although the Battle of Goliad, led by Fannin, was a Texas victory, he led a later battle which ended in surrender on his part. Santa Anna ordered for Fannin and his men to be executed near Goliad even though Anna’s counterparts disagreed with the punishment.
